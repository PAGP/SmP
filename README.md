# School Messenger
This is a messenger for school, which can be used in the network from school.

The BE (**B**ack**E**nd) is written in Python3 and the FE (**F**ront**E**nd) is up to you :D.
All endpoints and specifications can be found in the [Specification](#Specification).

# Info
The versions `v1` and `v2` (listed in the [WhitePaper](WHITEPAPER.md)) are NOT included in this snapshot.
They 'll be available ~~next year (2022)~~ this year (now).

UPDATE: the code (in DEMO) won't be updated because there are to many changes... (sadly you can't test the rate-limiting)

It's unclear if we can launch the server next year (again 2022), but we 'll inform you in the file [`Server-Launch`](Server-Launch).
*The content 'll be set to `false` if we can't launch the server*

# Specification
The specification can be looked up in the [WhitePaper](WHITEPAPER.md).
