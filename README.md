# School Messenger
This is a messenger for school, which can be used in the network from school.

The BE (**B**ack**E**nd) is written in Python3 and the FE (**F**ront**E**nd) is up to you :D.
All endpoints and specifications can be found in the [Specification](#Specification).

# Info
The versions `v1` and `v2` (listed in the [WhitePaper](WHITEPAPER.md)) are NOT included in this snapshot.
They 'll be available next year (2022).

UPDATE: the code (in DEMO) won't be updated because there are to many changes...

It's unclear if we can launch the server next year (again 2022), but we 'll inform you in the file [`Server-Launch`](Server-Launch).
*The content 'll be set to `false` if we can't launch the server*

# Specification
The specification can be looked up in the [WhitePaper](WHITEPAPER.md).
